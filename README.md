This project explores basic scheduling metrics to understand trends in appointment volume, cancellations, and no-show behavior. The goal is to practice foundational data skills using simple, realistic healthcare scenarios.

Metrics included:

Daily appointment counts

Completed vs. cancelled appointments

No-show rates

Average appointments per staff member

Peak scheduling days

Patient type breakdown (new vs established)

Tools used:

Excel

(Optional later) Power BI for visualization

What I’m learning:

Organizing raw scheduling data

Creating simple charts

Calculating basic metrics

Presenting insights clearly

Connecting data to real workflow issues in patient access
